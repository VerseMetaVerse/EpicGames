## What’s coming to Epic Games

Disney had previously announced a $1.5 billion equity investment in Epic Games. At Saturday’s D23 event, the company announced new players in Fortnite, a portion of the presentation that was watchable via livestream on that platform.

- The new characters  include ones from Disney, Star Wars and Pixar’s “The Incredibles.” The next Marvel season coming to Fortnite will come on August 16 and feature Dr. Doom.

“This is what Disney needed tonight - a big, emotional win with its biggest fans. The next step is to amplify that excitement to draw in casual fans and occasional visitors. That’s Disney’s next challenge, going forward,” Niles said.
